During this class, we will use NEURON 8.2. Please follow the instruction to install the software **before** the first exercise class.

Please also install the following Python packages:

Numpy

Scipy

Matplotlib

Pandas

JupyterLab

Please install them by following the instructions at their homepages.

**Class Schedule**

**Class 1: Modeling exercises introduction (January 25th, 15-17)** 
In this class, we will see an introduction of the NEURON software. We will discuss about the advantages of using Neuron compared to other available softwares and we will start creating very small compartmental models. We will learn the basics about using Neuron graphical interface and we will learn how to write simple .hoc code. 

**Class 2: Modeling exercises #1 (February 29th, 15-17)**
In this class, we will work with a neuron model reconstructed from an experimentally measured morphology. We will discuss how to build/run the simulations of electrophysiology experiments and analyze how their responses to inputs are governed by their biophysical properties.

**Class 3: Modeling exercises #2 (March 14th, 15-17)**
In this class, we will use the lessons from a previous class to understand the integration fo synaptic inputs in model neurons. We will also learn about active mechanisms and how they impact the input integration and output generation.

**Class 4: Modeling exercises #3 (March 28th, 15-17)**
In this class, we will learn more about modeling active mechanisms.

**Class 5: Modeling exercises #3 (April 11th, 15-17)**
In this class, we will learn the basics about using NEURON for implementing network models
